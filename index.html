Your kindness, strength, and quiet love helped build the home and life we shared. I am grateful for every moment, every laugh, and every challenge we overcame together. Even though you are no longer here with me, your love remains alive in my heart, and I will carry your memory with me for the rest of my days.

You taught us how to be strong, how to be kind, and how to love others with honesty and humility. We will always remember your laughter, your advice, and the way you made each of us feel special. Even though we wish you were still here, we are thankful for the love and lessons you left us. You will forever live in our hearts and in the people we become.
